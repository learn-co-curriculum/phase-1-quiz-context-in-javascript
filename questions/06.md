# Context: This

Inside a function, we use the \_\_\_\_ keyword to access the function's context
object and its properties. For example, what keyword would you need to use in
order to log `byronPoodle`'s name when the `warn` method is called?

```javascript
const byronPoodle = {
  name: "Byron",
  ageInYears: 2,
  warn: function () {
    console.log( _______.name);
    console.log(`Bark bark bark`);
  },
};
byronPoodle.warn();
```

## Correct

this
