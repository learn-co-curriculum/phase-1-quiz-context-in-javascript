# Context: Apply

Say we have a `sendUpdate` function that we want to use to send an account
update to one of our customers (`customer1`). `sendUpdate` takes two arguments:
the message text and the date. Which of the following shows the correct
invocation of `apply`?

## Correct

```javascript
sendUpdate.apply(customer1, [message, date]);
```

> Correct! We call the `apply` method on the `sendUpdate` function, passing in two
> arguments: the desired context object, and an array containing the arguments to
> be passed along to `sendUpdate`.

## Incorrect

```javascript
sendUpdate.apply(customer1, { message, date });
```

> Close! However, the arguments that will be passed along to sendUpdate should be
> enclosed in an array rather than in curly brackets.

## Incorrect

```javascript
sendUpdate.apply(customer1, message, date);
```

> Close! However, the arguments that will be passed along to `sendUpdate` should
> be enclosed in an array. This syntax would work if you used the `call` method
> method instead.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
