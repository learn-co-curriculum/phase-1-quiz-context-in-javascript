# Context: Bind

The \_\_\_\_ method returns a copy of the function it is called on, in which the
context is "set" to the object that's passed to it as an argument.

Example:

```javascript
const thor = {
  firstName: "Thor",
  familyName: "Odinsson",
};
function introWithContext(line) {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.familyName} says: ${line}`;
}

const thorIntro = introWithContext.______(thor);
thorIntro("Sup?");
// => Thor Odinsson says: Sup?
```

## Correct
