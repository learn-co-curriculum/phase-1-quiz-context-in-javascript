# Context: Call

How can I use the `call` method to return `person1`'s full name?

```javascript
const person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const person1 = {
  firstName: "Sonia",
  lastName: "Sotomayor",
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "Elena",
  lastName: "Kagan",
};
```

## Correct

```javascript
person.fullName.call(person1);
```

> Correct! The function being called is `person.fullName`, and we pass the desired
> context object (`person1`) as the argument. Since the `fullName` function
> doesn't take any arguments, we only need to pass the one argument to `call`.

## Incorrect

```javascript
person1.call(fullName);
```

> `call` is a method that needs to be called on a function, in this case`person.fullName`. The argument we pass to it is the context object, `person1`. The method call, therefore, should look like this:`person.fullName.call(person1)`.

## Incorrect

```javascript
person.call(person1);
```

> Close! But `call` is a method that needs to be called on a function, and`person`
> is not a function! Instead we need to call the `call` method
> on`person.fullName`. The method call, therefore, should look like
> this:`person.fullName.call(person1)`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
