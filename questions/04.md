# Context: Execution Context

When a JavaScript function is invoked, which of the following are included in
its _execution context_?

## Correct

The function's execution context includes all of these.

> Correct! The function will have a _function execution context_ that contains
> references to any functions or variables defined within it, but its overall
> execution context also includes the \_global execution context\_and the contexts
> of any functions it is enclosed in.

## Incorrect

The global execution context.

> This is partially correct - the function's execution context does _include_ the
> global execution context, but it also includes its own function execution
> context and the contexts of any functions it is enclosed in.

## Incorrect

The function execution context.

> This is partially correct - the function does have its own function execution
> context, but its overall execution context also includes the global execution
> context and the contexts of any functions it is enclosed in.

## Incorrect

The context of anything available via the scope chain.

> This is partially correct - the function's execution context does _include_ the
> contexts of any functions it is enclosed in, but it also includes its own
> function execution context and the global execution context.
